After yesterday being one of those days that achieving satisfaction seemed low down the list, today has provided
success in bounds, not least my $1500 overcharge with a car hire company got resolved, I won't mention the name Although Vindicated I Should.

So with a bounce in my step, it felt like the right time to make the move from wordpress, not that I have a problem with the platform - it's
that I love the idea of moving back to some cleaner interfaces, almost the same as a driver wanting to feel the road and feeling disapointment everytime
they get into a new car with power steering.   There is an opporuntity at the moment to be retro and up to date at the same time, so while we have spent years 
villifying text in favour of the hypnotic time consumer of font formatting - we can now get back to the idea that 'content is king'
