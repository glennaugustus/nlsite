### Oh for the love of Coffee and Chocolate.

There are so many things that are bad for you, or so we are told.  My personal view is that listening to your body is a much better indicator of how good, or not, things are for you.  

Take Coffee and Chocolate as an example - my body **knows** when I consume poorly made or mass produced coffee or chocolate.  It's about the purity, or more precisiely whatever they add / process to make the ubiqutous instant in such mass quantities.

It seems also that I function better using certain coffee brands... now it's entirely possible that this is complete rubbish, but if it works for me, then leave me in my state of happiness.
