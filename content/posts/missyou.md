The last year or so, there has been some sad losses, notably from facebook friends, some expected others not, all painful, I thought I would share this - I wrote it a few months ago - it's not Keats but it works for me.  It was inspired by the loss of my dad many years ago, my aunt and uncle and a facebook post by one of my friends who lost their father too. Simply called 'Miss You'

If i could say one thing to you who’s not here

to echo a memory so you won’t disappear

So much I could choose from, which story to tell?

The time we found photos? or The family is well?

You know all the stories, as you live on in me

my eyes are still your eyes and we choose what to see

I soon come to realise, just one thing won’t last

as soon as I say it, it’s into the past

frantically searching through memories to say

your presence seems stronger than usual today

your hand reaches out and presses my lip

silencing whirlwinds of thought with one tip

I sense you so closely, with emotions so real

speaking, you capture what I really feel

“so as you can hear me and imagine my touch,

I love you forever and I miss you so much”
