Some days are lovely, no clouds in the sky  
I can see things for miles, from here, way up high

sun bathing one day and drinking through straws  
weighing down parents who are also in-laws

now i’m the oldest my purpose is clear  
i’ve done all my growing, my destiny near

the leaves are all chanting, “go on, release!”  
one day I will do, if only for peace

it’s such a way down, with my vertigo  
i’m jealous of others on branches so low

i’ve seen how they do it, but it’s so hard to hear  
if the screams fade through distance or the ground soaks up fear

soon will be my day, the weather just right  
some rain for soft landings, some sun so it’s bright

a light breeze will wish me good luck on my trip  
it’s angry big brother will loosen my grip

while I hang here waiting, fearing the fall  
inside me a blueprint, awaiting its call

see i’m just an apple, stuck here on a tree  
but tomorrow or some day, that tree will be me
